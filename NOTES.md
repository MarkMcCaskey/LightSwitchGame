# Misc notes to keep track of things I'm ignoring

## Off by 1 error when texturing trees...
got to tree_06 and I had started counting from 001. All tree nodes may need to be decremented by one, aka tree01_002 should be using tree.png not tree01.png
- not a huge deal but proportions might be wrong. Needs looking into later but I don't care for now.

## Plates have wrong texture applied
I didn't realize there was a plate texture, redo those

## Ceiling texture
I missed this and applied white plaster to it. Need to find and update all these
